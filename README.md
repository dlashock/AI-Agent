# AI-Agent

This project was created as part of a [boot.dev](https://boot.dev) course to explore the integration of AI agents into software development workflows. The core objective was to build a tool that leverages the Gemini AI model to assist developers in understanding, improving, and maintaining their codebase.

## Features

- **Code Explanation**: The AI agent can provide detailed explanations for different sections of your code, making it easier to understand complex logic or unfamiliar codebases.
- **Bug Detection & Fixing**: Upon request, the agent can analyze your code for potential bugs and suggest or apply fixes.
- **Code Refactoring**: The agent can recommend and perform code refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
- **Interactive Assistance**: All actions are performed only when explicitly requested, giving you full control over your code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent.git
    ```
2. Follow the setup instructions in the project to configure access to the Gemini API.

## Usage

Interact with the AI agent through the provided interface or CLI. Request explanations, bug fixes, or refactoring as needed.

## Motivation

Building this project was a fun and educational experience, showcasing the power of AI in modern software development. It demonstrates how AI can be a valuable assistant for developers, streamlining code review and improvement processes.
